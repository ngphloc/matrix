Help me to change the book title from "Matrix Algebra and Calculus" to "Matrix Analysis and Calculus"
To: c.evans@lap-publishing.com
Dear madam
Thank you very much for giving me a chance to revise the book.
After reviewing the carefully, I found that have made some mistakes.
The book title is not matched exactly with the book content because the book focuses on applications of matrix processing whereas the concept "matrix algebra" belongs to abstract algebra such as theories of group, ring, field.

Therefore, I want to change the book title to "Matrix Analysis and Calculus".
Please help me to do that.

The attached is the revised version of the book.
Best regards,

Do you agree matrix computation is the most important in data analysis, real-time apllications, etc.? Yes, of course.
But matrix analysis like diagonaliztion, decomposion, etc. are very complicated.
Especially, matrix calculus with matrix derivative is the hazard problem.
It is very easy for you to comprehend these concepts with the book "Matrix Analysis and Calculus".
This book is easily understandable manual. You can look up any formula. All formulas are simplified by the best way.

The book is available on https://www.shuyuan.sg/store/gb/book/matrix-analysis-and-calculus/isbn/978-3-659-69400-4

The price is very cheap.
Do buy it! Do enjoy it!
Following is the abstract of the book.

Statistics, multivariate data analysis and convex optimization are applied widely in many scientific domains and most analytical techniques are developed based on matrix analysis and matrix calculus because matrix is abstract representation of multivariate data. Although it is slightly confused for us to comprehend their concepts and theories, matrix analysis and calculus give us exciting results which enhance data analysis techniques to be more plentiful and accurate. So the report is survey of matrix analysis and calculus, which includes five main sections such as basic concepts, matrix analysis, matrix derivative, composite derivative, and applications of matrix. Matrix derivative and composite derivative are subjects of matrix calculus.
